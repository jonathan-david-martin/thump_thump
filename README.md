# created for the ludum dare 46 game jam
# uses p5.js

some early versions on the first day of the game jam were saved in p5 editor.

I tried to save with the addition of a major change or feature so people who are new to p5.js or coding could follow along or recreate. (although since it was done so quickly, there are many things that are hacky and brute force -- especially as it got close to the deadline)
